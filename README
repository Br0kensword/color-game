This is my first repo on github featuring code for an interactive website that allows users to make fields of
 
mosaic color tiles within the playing field. The site makes use of Javascript HTML/CSS and jQuery effects

along with a random color generator that will eventually be expanded to include a much larger selection of

colors as well as a more sophisticated game to be played.
